It is **Spring MVC** web project, a website **back-end** side of one internet community website.

It uses many different technologies like Jsoup, JDA (Java Discord API) for Discord Bot which reads messages from some Discord channels and post them to website, Hibernate + JDBC Template mix for DB, primivite Spring Security authorization for admins' page, AOP for visits control and etc.

Front-end side was made by Valkyrie (https://github.com/r3valkyrie?tab=repositories). Thank him for help.
